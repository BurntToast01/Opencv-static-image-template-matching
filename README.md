OpenCV template matching for static images.
This project will: 
find the dimension of the given template/s,
capture a live stream of the entire screen in order to match the given template/s,
and performed an action of clicking on the template once found.
This a very useful GUI automation tool outside of selenium or when wanting to interact with a GUI.

For now it lacks a GUI to use and required a little bit of set up from the user.
Once a batch of giving templates are given it will go through a loop matching one or all the given templaes and clicking on them.
